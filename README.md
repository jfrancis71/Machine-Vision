Machine Vision Mathematica Code

#NOTE This codebase is migrating to CognitoNet where it is beiing tidied up (27/04/2016)
[CognitoNet](https://github.com/jfrancis71/CognitoNet)



This is a version 0.2 level codebase to support machine vision experiments. The codebase has an MIT open source license, and I am
in the process of adding that to the files.

Most interesting part is probably the neural network library which provides a straightforward way to
build modern neural networks, including convolution nets.

I have succesfully applied this to face recognition, gender recognition (which works quite well) and
a self driving car (EV3 lego robot).

Please see: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0xRU1SjWPmsdlyivlHWsCw
for demonstrations.

Current state is that much of the neural network codebase is quite modular and works well together, but parts of the
codebase are a bit rough and could do with improvement.

Please feel free to contact me (via github) for any help, especially for help to get it up and installed properly. It is quite straight
forward to install (when you know how), but this is something which needs further improvement. So please contact me for this.
